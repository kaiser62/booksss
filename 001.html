
"If you could just take a look at this here Almighty Creator, over
fifteen thousand planets that have recently collapsed on the edge of
universe twenty-three and it would seem it wasn't by natural cause."
spoke a tall woman.

She had long blond hair that was tight up into a bun and green eyes. Her
figure was amazing almost like a walking goddess. She was dressed like
an office assistant in a white variant of clothing. Even more so there
were a pair of large white wings attached to her that she constantly
swung around as if trying to move things along faster.

"I know I know. Universe twenty-three. Omniscient remember? It's Lucy
throwing a tantrum again. Did I ever tell you that on THIS level
specifically there's a rare sword drop when you kill respawnable slimes
five thousand times? I mean that's insane who would spend hours killing
slimes that many times? Me that's who." replied another voice.

This man was young looking and had red-brownish hair. His eyes gleamed
light aqua blue. He was incredibly handsome even more so than your
average Casanova and had simple plain clothing on. A white shirt and
some white pants with white sneakers, casual enough apart from the color
scheme. He sat in front of a small TV playing what appeared like a retro
RPG game. The room was just white and nothing else was there besides the
TV, and the two of them. His entire focus was on it as the woman spoke
up once again.

"God, almighty across the heav-"

"Please stop with the praising already. Do you see this?! I totally
dodge that slime this game is rigged!" he moaned out loud as he
passionately continued to play his game.

"Kami, please there's a large amount of work that require your attention
and we must get this done by the end of today. Handling all these
universes you created is only something you can do" she replied

Kami simply raised his fingers at her and snapped them. He replied in a
satisfied tone.

"There, I've rebuilt the planets back in their place. I swear those
little rebel demon brats running around making a mess then I have to
step in and clean it. You wanna live by yourself fine but stop breaking
my stuff. I'll have a talk with him sooner or later."

"Great Benevolent Creator, oh might the Cosmos and all who live in it
forever praise you, may your-"

Kami sighed and continued playing his game. The praising would take a
while so he had a few minutes of free time before the next inevitable
task would show itself. As his character swung his sword at the slimes
he began to contemplate his everlasting life.

Ever since he could remember he had always had to be there to step in
and fix something from the universe. From the first universe he had
created and left to the other hundreds he had made after that. Maybe it
was his fault but he couldn't help himself. If he suddenly had what he
thought was a neat concept he would immediately start to work on making
an entire universe around it until he lost interest and moved on to the
next one. Out of everything he had created, universes where human
created RPGs always caught his attention. Something about living your
life as an everyday commoner who then becomes an adventure and lastly a
hero was thrilling to him. The fantasy of it all the heroics and mostly
the world around it. He had created a universe based around RPGs like
these countless times and he always allowed them to run themselves. He
never thought of putting his influence over those universes he created.

He gave a low moan as he heard the angel next to her continue to praise
him. Even so he couldn't help but grow bored. He loved all he created
but after watching it millions and millions of years' worth of time in
action it grew a bit stale to him.

"Kami, did you hear what I said?"

"Yeah something about the humans from the first universe expecting the
apocalypse soon or something. I tell you out of all the humans I created
those are the most fanatic. Constantly praying for me to save them and
stuff, I go take a look and everything seems to be running fine on its
own. Sure, they have a bit of war here and there but mostly it's just
peaceful. They want free will but soon as the get a boo-boo they come
crying to me" he commented putting the control down and standing up.

"So why not just close up that universe, bring all the believers into
heaven and put a stop to it?" questioned the angel as she continued to
flap her wings.

"Ah that's a stupid question what about the other creations I put in
there." He walked off towards a shelf that had suddenly appeared. The
shelf contained many other RPG titles.

The angel glanced at the game he was playing and saw that Kami had
already defeated the five thousand slimes to receive the sword. She
murmured in a low tone

"He cheated?"

"Hey hey hey!" Kami looked at her in a panic tone "I don't cheat!
Everyone just moves too slow for what I do I practically got this done
ten minutes ago. Ask me how that's possible if I just started playing
five minutes ago. Go on then."

"Of course, your most-"

"Shush" he returned his attention to the shelf in front of him.

He only wished he could find something exciting to do besides creating
universes and fixing them up after giving them free will or some dark
enemy lurking around messing them up. If only he could live his life as
one of the heroes from one of his favorite RPG's. Suddenly his face lit
up as he looked up at Sayu.

"Sayu listen to me closely, I just had a brilliant idea!"

With great speed she took out what appeared to be a tablet and looked
closely at him. She seemed ready to write down and complete any request
he gave her.

"What other idea for a universe do we have today Almighty?" she asked
with great care.

"No no no, nothing like that. I'm going into one of the universe I
created and live life as an adventurer. I've made enough RPG-style
universes that I could pick one and interreact with it? That would be
the first time in thousands of years that I've done that and definitely
the first time I go into one as one of them!"

Sayu stared dumbfounded at the being in front of her.

"Not just that Sayu. I'll do this and help humanity as an adventurer.
Imagine that! I would go from an adventurer to a hero to them as I stand
against all enemy of them. I mostly just wanna go around traveling and
doing all sorts of stuff but being a hero along the way wouldn't hurt."

"But your benevolence! You are already God of everything and everyone.
Why strive for such a small title? "she replied in a frantic voice.

"Ah but not like this Sayu. Everyone is naturally expected to bow to me,
for some reason, but with this I will be seen in a new light! Can you
imagine? God in the front line against enemies of humanity. Is that not
just a right cause to get everyone riled up! Including myself!"

"B-but with a snap of a finger you could just do THAT? Why do this?!"
she asked in confusion.

"Sayu, it's just more fun that way. Just take it as word from God
himself" he spoke as he lifted his fingers in a snapping motion.

"N-no wait Kami if you leave heaven unattended like this everything will
fall apart!"

He froze for a second and began thinking. He was dead set on going to a
universe where he would become not just an adventurer but a hero but he
also wasn't going to be careless enough to leave all of creation
unattended. He would have to leave someone in his stead. Someone who he
could trust to do the right thing when it came down to it. Kami turned
his eyes at her and smiled mischievously.

"Sayu, I now temporary assign you my role as God of All Creation. While
you hold my job do take care of all my lovely creations, or you're fired."

"M-me, God of all Creation, I don't even know where to begin! I don't
even have the power to do such a thing! Wait what do you mean f-fired?!
Wait please why are you doing this!?"

Without a further warning he snapped his fingers and founds himself
falling through the blue sky. Below him was nothing but a grand
landscape of mountains and bodies of water. He laughed at the idea of
what he would do when he landed in this grand world he had created. It
had been sometime since he felt so thrilled that he didn't notice that
he was fast approaching the ground. Kami soon landed on the ground as a
loud crashing noise echoed through out the area. Dust spread across the
impact area and soon settled. Where he laid a huge crater had been formed.

Even so he stared up at the sky smiling as if he had accomplished an
amazing feat.

"Fresh new start" he sat up and looked at his clothing. His white
clothing were now covered with dirt and dust some of it was even torn.
He stood up and almost instantaneously his clothing looked like new as
if nothing had happened.

By the looks of it he had landed right in the middle of a road that
would probably lead to a town. He decided to limit his Omniscient
ability from this moment forth as knowing everything that would happen
or where it was would ruin it for him. He wanted the full feel of an
adventurer and exploring unknown territory was part of it.

"If I remember correctly-" he thought about his stats for a second and a
status bar showed itself in front of his eyes.

He read through his stats a few times summarizing that this would
probably not be as hard as he had thought it would be. He then opened
his Passive Menu and took a close look.

*[Passives]*

*Omnipotent*: Lvl. Max

*Omnipresent*: Lvl. Max

*Omniscient*: Lvl. Max

*Immortal*: Lvl Max

*Untouchable*: Lvl Max

(Further Passives may be unlocked through progression and class
changes)(For list of Skills open the Status Menu)

Kami noticed that he was able to toggle his passives on and off as
needed and decided to toggle omnipresent and omniscient off. He would
keep Omnipotent on but if he got too bored from just killing everything
off easily, as he clearly knew he would be able to, he would also toggle
it off.  The other two seemed fair to keep on, if he somehow died
despite having what seemed like infinite HP, all of creation would go
down with him. Not the best scenario for all of existence. Further more
he noticed that the passives had a level to them as well, not that it
mattered since his was clearly maxed out. He now opened his Skill Menu
to see if what he had.

*[Skill Menu]*

"Hmm...in a typical RPG standard I'm pretty sure these are either
Overpowered or cheated in stats and passives...what's with the title,
Runaway God? Not hero or something like that? Either case I should
probably restrain myself. I do want to appear strong but too much and
people will freak out, right? What's with the Charisma?! Am I not a
charming God is that what it's saying? I have endless followers across
many universes and even more so, whats with the skills? That seriously
makes me look like I cheated somehow" he shrugged closing his Skill Menu
and looking around the area.

From what he could see there was no signs of life around but the
atmosphere was tranquil and comforting. Kami took in a few deep breaths
before reinforcing his convictions. Now that he was in this world he
would enjoy it as though it was a new game he was opening. The feel and
excitement of it was incomparable.

"Alright! The grand adventure begins!"

With this he jumped out of the crater and began walking down the road,
excited to start his new life as an adventurer.
