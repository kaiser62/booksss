				TL Notes: In response to the possible question: “Why are you not translating from where the last translator left off?” please allow me to say a few words. This is my first translation project, and I am only getting up to speed. The initial translation for this chapter, with some 1600 words, took me about 1 hour 40 minutes. I am testing the waters and seeing how doable this is while experimenting with style and such. Please offer me criticism and suggestions. Enjoy:<br/><br/>Prologue –  Death and Reincarnation<br/><br/>A life so normal that nothing can be said about it.<br/>After leaving college, I joined a major general contractor firm and am living alone now at the age of 37. Having no girlfriend.<br/>Filial duty left to my older brother, my life is essentially that of an independent, single noble.<br/>Neither short of height, or wanting of a good face. Yet unpopular. I have tried exherting effort into finding a girlfriend – and have confessed thrice! – but after being dumped, my heart is left shattered. Well, having reached this age, I can honestly say that this romance thing is naught but troublesome.<br/>And although you could say that I am mostly busy with work, it’s not like I am troubled by not having one. It’s not like I am making excuses… really.<br/><br/>「Senpai! Sorry for keeping you waiting!」<br/><br/>With a cheerful smile the young man approaches me. And, by his side–a beauty.<br/>More specifically, the young man, Tamura, is a junior at the same company I work at; the one by his side is our company’s renowned Madonna, the receptionist Sawatari-san.<br/>Yep, I have been asked by these guys to offer consultation on their upcoming marriage. And by the way, this is the reason why I started wondering about my own unpopularity.<br/>The after-work rendezvous was held at an intersection, and there the two hoped to indulge my thoughtfulness and support.<br/><br/>「Yeah. So, what kind of advice are you looking for?」<br/><br/>I ask while greeting Sawatari-san.<br/><br/>「Hello, pleased to meet you.My name is Sawatari Miho. Although we have seen each other before, this would be the first time we are speaking, right? Makes me nervous, somehow. 」<br/><br/>The nervous one is me, damn it! I mean, I am not that good with speaking to girls in the first place. Cut me some slack! With such words, I silently complain to myself.<br/>And in the first place, with no apparent love experience, what kind of advice can I even offer? Aren’t you all just poking fun at me! It’s spite, isn’t it.<br/><br/>「Hello. I am Mikami Satoru. No need to be nervous or anything. Sawatari-san is famous with us, so I know who you are even without the introduction. About Tamura–we went to the same University, you know, so we’ve had lots to talk about. After which we naturally hung out a bit.」<br/><br/>「What’s this about being famous? Are there weird rumors floating about?」<br/><br/>「Yeah. Like having had an affair with Chief X, or going on dates with Y-kun–things like that.」<br/><br/>It was all just teasing, of course. And although I intended these to be just some light jokes, Sawatari-san’s face turned bright red and she looked at me with watery eyes. Hate to admit it, but she looked adorable.<br/>Well, my jokes lack both delicacy or tact, and I am often told to keep my mouth shut… but I end up saying them anyways.<br/>Yep, failed again, huh? Yep, I am just bad with women.<br/>And as if on cue, in steps Tamura, lightly tapping her shoulders.<br/>Damn it, Tamura you bastard! It’s these situations where you riajuu should just all explode! I should shout this, right?<br/><br/>「Senpai, please leave it at that! And, Miho, you are just being teased!」<br/><br/>With a laugh Tamura continues mediating the situation. Aren’t you dandy, junior!<br/>Bright, cheerful, and without a hint of sarcasm. Isn’t he a lovable guy…<br/>Tamura’s only 28. And although we are so many years apart, we’ve got something in common. Well, nothing to do I guess but to give them my blessing…<br/><br/>「My bad. I’m just not that good with women. And, well, the location doesn’t help much, does it? Let’s get something to eat and talk there.」<br/><br/>It’s just jealousy, after all. And just when I thought so…<br/><br/>「「「Kyaaaaaaaaaa!」」」<br/><br/>Screams. Confusion.<br/>What? What’s going on?<br/><br/>「Move it! I’ll kill you!」<br/><br/>Turning to the sound of the voice, a man brandishing a knife and holding a bag is running towards us.<br/>I hear the scream. I see the man. I see the knife. Where is it pointing? At….<br/><br/>「Tamuraaa!」<br/><br/>*Don* I hit Tamura out of the way.<br/><br/>*Dosu* There’s a burning pain in my back.<br/><br/>「Tch, damn hindrance!」<br/><br/>Having shouted thus, I see the man escaping and turn to make sure Tamura and Sawatari-san are safe.<br/>With a shout that resembled no words, Tamura runs up to me.<br/>Sawatari-san is stunned by the sudden turn of events, but appears without other injury… thank god.<br/>That being that, my back burns. Feelings of pain aside, it just burns.<br/>What’s up with this? It’s too hot… can’t it let off a bit?<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Establishing heat resistance. Success＞＞<br/><br/>Could it be… was I stabbed?<br/>Can’t be dying from a stab wound….<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Establishing pierce resistance. Success. Additionally, establishing physical attack resistance. Success＞＞<br/><br/>「Senpai… there’s blood coming out… it’s not stopping… it’s ain’t…」<br/><br/>What’s up with this loud guy. Feel like his voice was strange just now; well, that much can be expected from Tamura.<br/>But blood? Yeah, that’s clearly leaving. I am human, after all. When stabbed, I bleed!<br/>But pain is unpleasant, isn’t it….<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Removing perception of pain. Success＞＞<br/><br/>Well… this is bad, right? Pain and impatience are muddling my senses.<br/><br/>「Ta… Tamura… you are damn loud. It… is not that big of deal, right? Stop worrying…」<br/><br/>「Senpai… the blood… you keep…」<br/><br/>His face blue, on the verge of tears, Tamura continues to hold me. That’s the face that is the ruin of handsome men.<br/>I tried to take a look at how Sawatari-san was doing, but my vision is too hazy. Can’t see.<br/>The burning sensation in my back is gone. Instead, a ferocious cold strikes me.<br/>This could be bad… when people don’t have enough blood, they die, don’t they?<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Creating a bloodless body. Success＞＞<br/><br/>(Hey, you, what’s this you’ve been going on about the past few minutes….)<br/>I try to speak, but no words come out. This is bad, maybe I really will die….<br/>But hey, I no longer feel neither pain nor the burning.<br/>But it’s cold. So cold, and nothing I can do about it. What’s with this… I am too busy of a man to be freezing in this cold.<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Establishing cold resistance. Success. Additionally, heat resistance has successfully evolved into thermal fluctuation resistance EX＞＞<br/><br/>At that time, the dying brain cells of mine, with a flash of inspiration, have remembered the truly important things!<br/>Yes! The contents of my PC hard drive!<br/><br/>「Tamuraa!! If and only if, I say, I die… take care of my PC. I beg you… submerge it in water, turn it on, and completely wipe the data clean…」<br/><br/>Thus I, having summoned the remainder of my strength, have conveyed the matters of most grave importance.<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Attempting full format of all information. Error, impossible due to lack of definition. Attempting alternate interpretation. Establishing electricity resistance. Success. Additionally, paralysis resistance has been acquired＞＞<br/><br/>I don’t know exactly what Tamura was saying at that moment, while giving me that blank look.<br/>But, I understood the meaning of what was said.<br/><br/>「Haha… that’s so like Senpai…」<br/><br/>He said with a bitter smile. Who would even want to look at a man’s crying face? That grin is so many times better.<br/><br/>「You know, I… about Sawatari, I wanted to show her off to senpai…」<br/><br/>Heh, I knew it.. .this bastard.<br/><br/>「Tch… jeez. I’ve forgiven all of it, so your girlfriend, make her happy, got it? And take care of the PC…」<br/><br/>The last of my strength, was only enough to say that much.<br/>Completely unsatisfied, Mikami Satoru died.<br/>And at that instant, Mikami Satoru’s “soul” linked with a spawned monster in another world.<br/>Into a dimensional crack so small that no eye could see. His soul linked with a mass of demonic energy.<br/>This mass was the origin of demons, and to Mikami Satoru who had linked to it, his thoughts as a base, the mass constructed a body.<br/>What is normally is essentially an impossibility with an astronomically small chance of occurrence, Mikami Satoru was reborn as a monster in another world.<br/><br/>A life so normal that nothing can be said about it.<br/>After leaving college, I joined a major general contractor firm and am living alone now at the age of 37. Having no girlfriend.<br/>Filial duty left to my older brother, my life is essentially that of an independent, single noble.<br/>Thus, a virgin.<br/>Unbelievable, departing the world without ever been put to use… my ‘son’ must be crying right now.<br/>Sorry, I never could make you into an adult…<br/>When I am reborn, we’ll change things around. Go on the offensive with a bang. Call them out, and go on devouring spree…. But that’s no good, is it?<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Unique skill [Predator] has been acquired＞＞<br/><br/>And well, at almost forty years old, the thirty year old virgin that I am, in a magical world would certainly be a sage… heck, a great sage wouldn’t be out of the question, would it?<br/><br/>＜＜Confirmed. Extra skill [Sage] has been acquired. Additionally, extra skill [Sage] has successfully evolved into unique skill [Great Sage] ＞＞<br/><br/>…. the hell you’ve been on about? The hell is [Great Sage]! Are you making fun of me?<br/>It isn’t even a bit unique!<br/>I am not laughing here!<br/>So rude..<br/><br/>Thinking that, I went to sleep.<br/>(So this is death, huh… not as lonesome as I thought.)<br/>Those were, for Mikami Satoru, the lost words spoken in this word.<script>chaptererror();</script>
