Stunning Edge - C297

The hall was deathly silent. The cold air was suffocating.

With a cold face, Dittos slowly walked in through the door. Every step he took gave off an invisible pressure, and the person beside him took a step back. It made way for him.

Qi Ao Shuang came back to her senses at this time, but she did not stand up. Anger gradually appeared in her eyes.

To think that Dittos was so ruthless when he first attacked. Although Qi Ao Shuang needed to be intimidated, she was not willing to use such a brutal and bloody method to intimidate him.

With a gloomy expression, Dittas slowly walked up to Qi Ao Shuang. He lowered his eyes and looked at Qi Ao Shuang. His eyes were sharp and angry.

“I told you not to get distracted by other things.” Dittos’s voice was dark and cold.

Xiao Ao Shuang slowly stood up and looked coldly at Dentance. His gaze was also unusually sharp.

The two of them just stared at each other without saying anything.

The great hall was so quiet that the breathing of the crowd could be heard clearly.

Jonathan was a little nervous. He could tell that Xiao Ao Shuang was really angry, and Dittos was not in a good mood either.

The faces of Tarina and her group of disciples were incomparably pale, and they didn’t know what to do. They had heard of Dittas’ strength and eccentric personality, and seeing this with their own eyes made them even more nervous. The blood on the floor slowly began to turn black and solidified. It looked so shocking. All the elders of the Tian Dao Sect secretly swallowed their saliva, but no one dared to say anything. As a legendary figure, as long as he wanted to, he would probably be able to quickly flatten the Tian Dao Sect to the ground.

“I don’t need you to worry about my own matters.” After a long while, Xiao Ao Shuang finally said these words coldly.

After Xiao Ao Shuang said this, the expression on Dentance 'face darkened. His eyes became cold and he was about to say something.

“You shouldn’t be here.” I have a sense of proportion to my own affairs. " Xiao Ao Shuang didn’t give Dentance any chance to speak, but continued speaking with an even colder tone, “Also, Dentance, I want to tell you that I will break through to the Void Shattering Realm before you.” So you don’t have to worry about me. "

Dittas’ expression changed, and his eyes became even darker. Just like that, he glared at Qi Ao Shuang, who did not even bother to dodge. Her face was cold as she stared at Dentance.

Everyone in the hall was extremely nervous, and the atmosphere was extremely stiff.

Jonathan was anxious, his hands trembling into fists. Xiao Ao Shuang had truly angered Dentance. What would be the result if he did that? … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … …. However, no matter what, he must not let Dylan hurt Qi Ao Shuang even the slightest bit.

Tarina’s face was deathly pale as well. She watched the scene in front of her with concern and nervousness. She was more worried than anyone else about the safety of Qi Ao Shuang.

Just like that, the atmosphere in the hall froze. No one dared to speak, and no one dared to move.

It was as if a long time had passed.

“Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur …” Dittos suddenly smiled. Just like that, he suddenly laughed.

Qi Ao Shuang frowned, coldly looking at Dentance.

“Alright, I’ll wait for you to step into the Space Shattering Realm!” I’ll wait for you to step in first! If you are after me, I will kill all the people who have anything to do with you! " Dotans casually said so. Without any reaction from Gu Qi Ao Shuang, he turned around and left with an indifferent expression. Everyone made way again, fear rising in their hearts.

Xiao Ao Shuang stared at the back of Dittas, her eyes turning colder and colder.

At this moment, a thought suddenly appeared in Qi Ao Shuang’s mind.

Sooner or later, she would have a battle with this man!

Only when Dittas’s figure had completely disappeared from the hall’s entrance did Qi Ao Shuang retract her gaze and look at the silent crowd below.

The way the crowd looked at her was very complicated, very complicated.

The Star Academy’s Dittens had chased Qi Ao Shuang to the Tian Dao Sect, but for a laughable reason, he had started a massacre. What did this have to do with the Heaven’s Path Sect? Why did he make the people from the Heaven’s Path Sect die so easily?

These complex emotions included anger, unwillingness, hatred, and resentment …

However, no one dared to express their intentions, and no one dared to say anything. All of them were silently protesting with their eyes.

Qi Ao Shuang looked at the crowd silently. Finally, he moved his lips slowly and managed to say one sentence, “Second Elder, you should take over as the Sect Leader.” You’re the best. “Fourth Elder is a bit reckless, not suitable.”

The audience remained silent. No one dared to object. However, the expressions in everyone’s eyes became even more complicated.

After saying this, Qi Ao Shuang did not want to talk anymore. Looking at the corpses on the ground that had already cooled down, he let out a nearly inaudible sigh and then walked out. That person didn’t need to die. Yet, because he had died, he had died in such a miserable manner. There was no need for all this to develop to this point … His original intention was to solve the problem, not to let things turn out this way.

Xiao Ao Shuang walked down the hall slowly towards the door. The Second Elder stood behind him, watching Qi Aushuang’s back. He wanted to stop her, but Jonathan stepped forward and made a gesture to stop her. If the fourth elder glared at him and said something, this time, Jonathan didn’t wave his hand. Instead, he made a move, causing the fourth elder to scratch his neck, but he couldn’t say a word.

Talena stared at Xiao Ao Shuang’s back in a daze, a heart-wrenching feeling spreading through her body. Why did he feel that the back of Qi Ao Shuang was so bleak …

Everyone in the great hall stared at Qi Ao Shuang’s departing figure with burning eyes, their gazes filled with ill intent. Tarina just stood there, her heart aching. She understood that from then on, the Heavenly Dao Sect and Qi Ao Shuang would gradually get further and further away, and they would probably never meet again in the future. Could it be that he had made the wrong choice to ask for the help of Qi Ao Shuang this time around? Tarina’s heart felt incomparably sour.

Qi Ao Shuang walked forward slowly, Jonathan following behind, maintaining a certain distance, neither landing nor catching up. He knew that what Qi Ao Shuang needed right now was for him to calm down.

Dylan’s words still echoed in Qi Ao Shuang’s mind. This dangerous man … Would he have to kill everyone who had anything to do with him before he stepped into the Space Shattering Realm? This was unfathomable!

Just like that, Qi Ao Shuang walked forward silently, and Jonathan followed silently behind her. Xiao Ao Shuang had been walking forward unconsciously. When she came back to her senses, the sky had already darkened, and she found herself in a strange place.

In front of him was a wide canyon. Flowers covered the mountains and plains in all sorts of colors. The fragrance was intoxicating. The wind gently blew, and the petals that filled the sky gently flew about like a dream.

Where is this? Xiao Ao Shuang looked around, but there was no one around. Jonathan was not behind him at the moment, and he was nowhere to be seen.

Xiao Ao Shuang hesitated for a moment before slowly walking forward.

At this time, Jonathan was still hopping around at the mouth of the canyon. What the hell is this place?! So strange! No matter how hard he tried, he could not break through the barrier. No matter what he did, he would not be able to move it in the slightest. However, Qi Ao Shuang did not seem to be affected in the slightest as she passed through without any problems. When Jonathan wanted to continue following her, he found that he could not move forward anymore. He opened his mouth to call out to Qi Ao Shuang, but she did not react. It was as if that barrier could block everything, including the sound.

Just like that, Qi Ao Shuang entered the canyon and slowly walked forward. Multicolored fragrant petals filled the air, gradually becoming more and more mesmerizing. Suddenly, a strong wind blew by, causing the petals in the sky to fall into disorder. Qi Ao Shuang raised her hand to block her eyes from opening.

The wind stopped, the flowers fell.

Qi Ao Shuang lowered her hand, opened her eyes, and saw a man dressed in black standing before her. His back was facing her.

The man did not turn his head around. He only said lightly, “You’re here.” Not a question, just a faint acknowledgment. It was as if he knew that Xiao Ao Shuang would definitely come.

“Who are you?” Xiao Ao Shuang asked in a low voice.

“You smell of her.” That’s why you came in. " The man in black did not reply to Xiao Aoshuang, instead, he said something so deep and low that Xiao Aushuang did not understand.

“Her taste …?” Xiao Aushuang repeated the words of the man in black hesitantly, trying to guess who he was referring to.

“However, all of this is fated.” The man in black seemed to be sighing and regretting at the same time. After he finished speaking, he slowly turned around, revealing a handsome face that was full of shock.

Qi Ao Shuang stared at the person in front of her, her heart filled with doubt. Who is he? What was he talking about? Suddenly, Xiao Ao Shuang felt the abnormality in her body. It was the sky! At this time, the originally slumbering sky unexpectedly began to react. He seemed to be trembling, as if afraid.

“Oh, he actually likes you, too. Does he follow you?” The man in black smiled faintly, causing the world to pale. Reaching out his hand to grasp at thin air, Qi Ao Shuang instantly felt her body empty. When she looked up, she saw the black clothed man effortlessly grabbing the sky while the sky was trembling.

“Who, exactly, are you?” There was a trace of vigilance in Qi Ao Shuang’s heart.

“Me? Hur Hur, my name is Jing Feng.” The man in black smiled, looking at Xiao Ao Shuang and said, “I am Po’s relative.” So, I won’t hurt you and your little thing.

With a smile, he tossed the trembling Chang Kong to Xiao Ao Shuang. Qi Ao Shuang hurriedly reached out to catch it, because she could tell that even the sky was scared silly. If she hadn’t caught the sky, it would have definitely fallen to the ground.

After the sky was caught by Qi Ao Shuang, he finally regained his senses and slipped into Qi Ao Shuang’s body, no longer reacting.

“Ah’Bao’s family?” Qi Ao Shuang looked up at the smiling man in black, and finally understood that she was Ah’Bao. It was natural to say that she smelled like her. This was because Ah’Bao had been with her for a very long time, and for quite some time, he was still in her body.

“Yes, I am Ah’Bao’s only family.” As Jing Feng spoke up to here, a gentle smile appeared on his face.

“You …” Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she looked at the frightening wind in front of her. Her intuition told her that this person was definitely not simple. Because there was no trace of aura on his body, no surging power could be felt. The person in front of him was like an ancient well, serene and unperturbed. Suddenly, he felt as if he had become one with his surroundings. It was as if he was a tranquil ancient painting, as if it had been created by the heavens. It was as if the world was him, and he was the world.

It was a very strange feeling, and there was also a hint of fear.

“Qi Ao Shuang, are you ready to face your fate?” Jing Feng looked at the puzzled Qi Ao Shuang as he asked indifferently.

“What?” Xiao Aushuang was even more surprised, why did the person in front of her talk as if he knew so much?

“The path of destiny full of thorns …” Jing Feng seemed to be sighing, “Have you thought about retreating?”

“Never, not in the past, not now, not in the future!” Qi Ao Shuang shook her head resolutely and said seriously, “I will continue walking, and will not stop, no one can stop me.”

“Hur hur, I think so.” “That’s why he’s so determined to wait?” Jing Feng lowered his gaze, murmuring to himself. He seemed to be talking to Qi Ao Shuang, but at the same time, to himself.

“What do you know?” Xiao Aushuang was a little anxious, she felt that the man in front of her seemed to know more than she thought, why did he know that there was someone waiting for her? Xiao Ao Shuang asked again, “And who are you?” “Who is it?”

“Me?” “I am the guardian of this plane.” Jing Feng smiled. He raised his head and looked at the blue sky. He said softly, “It has never changed since ancient times …”

Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. She looked at the person in front of her and was speechless. Why did he see a faint sadness in this person’s eyes? It was a faint sadness of loneliness.

“However, your appearance may break this unchanging rule.” Jing Feng’s eyes were filled with sorrow for a moment, then he lowered his head and looked at Xiao Ao Shuang as he spoke softly.

“What exactly is in that plane?” “Break through the void, is there really an unknown conspiracy after stepping in?” This was the first time Xiao Ao Shuang asked such a question urgently about a person.

“Can’t you see it yourself?” However, Jing Feng didn’t directly answer him. Instead, he said those words with a slight smile.

Just as Xiao Ao Shuang was about to continue asking, Jing Feng said in a low voice, “The person you are looking for is still waiting for you.” To be fast. “Otherwise, even that person wouldn’t be able to protect himself …”

As soon as he said those words, a fierce wind blew, causing Qi Ao Shuang to almost be unable to stand properly.

“What?” What do you mean? That person couldn’t protect himself? Was it Camille? “Is this …” Qi Ao Shuang shouted towards the wind, her heart full of anxiety. The person in front of him definitely knew something. But why didn’t he explain it clearly? Instead, he said something that seemed to be true and false! The wind stopped, but there was no longer any sign of the wind.

The surroundings were still filled with fragrant flowers, and their eyes were brilliant. But there was no one there, as if the appearance of the wind was just an illusion.

The person you’re looking for is still waiting for you.

To be fast.

Otherwise, even that person wouldn’t be able to protect himself …

Was that Camil? Camille?

Camille can’t protect himself? How could this be? What had happened to Camille?

Suddenly, Qi Ao Shuang’s heart was filled with a monstrous impatience. He must break through as soon as possible. He had to go to that plane! Leng Lingyun’s words are still fresh in my mind. We will wait for you!

Xiao Ao Shuang took a deep breath, trying her best to calm herself down. He then slowly sat down and began to organize his thoughts. From the Star Academy’s actions to the mysterious man in white’s attempts to stop them, to Jing Feng’s meaningful words …

Gradually, his thoughts became clearer and clearer, but at the same time, there seemed to be a key point that he could not grasp. `

What was it?

Just like that, Xiao Aushuang sat there quietly, forgetting everything around her.

Time and space seemed to cease to exist at this moment.

Just like that, she slowly entered a wondrous state that could not be described with words.

He forgot everything, even himself.

What she couldn’t see was a few gentle gusts of wind swirling around her. Finally, it slowly entered her body and disappeared.

When Qi Aushuang woke up again, a bright sun was hanging in the sky. Qi Ao Shuang slowly stood up and looked around, but there didn’t seem to be any change. She raised her head to look at the depths of the canyon, but in the end, she didn’t plan to enter. Instead, she turned around and walked out.

When he walked to the entrance of the canyon, he was surprised to find the haggard Jonathan sitting at the side, dozing off.

“Jonathan, why are you here?” Xiao Ao Shuang asked in surprise.

“Huh?” Jonathan shuddered as if waking from a dream and immediately stood up. “Ao Shuang, you’ve finally come out.”

“What?” “How did you know I was here?” What are you looking for me for? How long? Why don’t you go in and look for me? "

Qi Ao Shuang’s words left Jonathan at a loss whether to laugh or cry. He could only rub his head and say, “Ao Shuang, did you forget that after you left the Tian Dao Sect, you were so focused on moving forward that you didn’t even notice me following you?” After that, I came here. There is a barrier here, so you can enter it as you wish. However, I can’t enter no matter what, so I can only wait for you here. It’s been half a month, and you’ve finally come out. "

“What?!” “Half a month?” Qi Ao Shuang was shocked. She only felt that she had been sitting for an entire night, how could it be that half a month had passed?

"Yeah, or you’d think I’d be so haggard. I’m so worried about you, but I can’t get in. Are you all right? “What happened in there?” Jonathan looked her up and down, more and more amazed. Xiao Ao Shuang seemed a little different, but what was different about her?

“I’m fine.” Qi Ao Shuang smiled, looked at the haggard Jonathan and patted him on the shoulder, “Thank you.”

“Ao Shuang, you seem to be different.” Jonathan looked at Qi Ao Shuang with a frown. He stroked his chin and stared at Qi Ao Shuang with widened eyes.

“Let’s go back.” I think things have to be solved. " Qi Ao Shuang revealed a faint smile as she looked up into the sky, her eyes filled with determination.

“Ao Shuang …?” Jonathan was puzzled, but he could feel that Qi Ao Shuang’s mood had changed a little during this half a month.

“It’s a good thing to know you, Jonathan.” Qi Ao Shuang smiled, and with a light tap of her feet, she flew up into the sky. She didn’t wait for Jonathan to regain his senses, and flew directly in the direction of Star Academy.

Jonathan watched Qi Ao Shuang’s back for a while before coming back to his senses. Then he smiled foolishly and chased after her.

When Qi Aushuang returned to the exit of the Star Academy, she was stunned by the sight before her. Two people sat listlessly on the stone steps, one on each side. To the left was Palina, to the right was Tarina. Both of them were in a bad mood. They rested their hands on their chins and occasionally paused for a moment. Both of them were dozing off.

What was going on? Qi Ao Shuang looked at the two with a puzzled expression.

At this time, Jonathan landed as well. He squinted his eyes and yawned loudly, “I’m so tired. I’m so sleepy. I’m going to sleep like hell today. I’m going to sleep for three days and three nights without getting up!”

The two men on the steps were awakened by Jonathan’s voice. They looked up and saw the man they had been waiting for.

“Qi Ao Shuang!”

“Junior brother …”

The two women stood up at the same time and ran towards Qi Ao Shuang. His face was filled with wild joy, and the worry in his eyes was slowly dissipating. Apparently, the two of them were waiting for Qi Ao Shuang’s return!

Qi Ao Shuang’s heart suddenly had an ominous feeling and she quickly retreated.

The two women did not care too much, and their targets were both Qi Ao Shuang’s arms. They moved quickly, and were about to pounce onto Qi Ao Shuang’s arms.

When Jonathan saw this, his expression changed and he immediately rushed forward bravely like a bolt of lightning. He pulled Qi Aushuang behind him and then shamelessly opened his arms. The two ladies jumped into Jonathan’s arms without stopping.

Qi Ao Shuang stood behind Jonathan with her mouth wide open in shock. The two girls threw themselves into Jonathan’s arms. Jonathan looked as if he was sacrificing his life.

“Why are you so warm?” “Haha, although I, Jonathan, am handsome and extraordinary, I can’t bear to pounce on two of them at once.” Jonathan laughed and exclaimed this sentence with apparent excitement.
