Stunning Edge - C300

“Qi Ao Shuang …” After a long time, Dittas finally spoke first, calling out Qi Ao Shuang’s name in a low voice. This was the first direct exchange between the two of them since they left the Tian Dao Sect.

Jonathan looked at Qi Ao Shuang nervously before looking at Dittas. Ever since the return of the Tian Dao Sect, the relationship between the two had dropped to a freezing point. They had not spoken a word, but now that they had met face to face, what would happen?

Xiao Ao Shuang looked coldly at Dentance and asked in a deep voice: “What’s the matter?”

“How do you feel now?” This was what had originally been Diantz’s main concern. He was concerned about how Qi Ao Shuang was feeling right now. In short, he was still far from breaking through.

“I will break through before you.” Qi Ao Shuang said without any hesitation.

“Good, very good.” Before me, anyone you have anything to do with doesn’t have to die. But if you break through with me, they’re still going to die. “The existence of those people will prevent you from advancing any further …” Before he could finish his words, a strong gale instantly arose in the surroundings. The fierce gale blew away everyone’s clothes, and their hair was in disarray.

And all of this was done with Qi Ao Shuang as the center. Innumerable gusts of wind gushed out from Qi Ao Shuang’s body, filling the surroundings. Qi Ao Shuang’s expression sank to the bottom, and her eyes became even colder. He just stared at Dittos coldly. A gust of wind instantly cut a bloody wound on Dittas’ handsome face, and blood began to slowly flow out.

Dotans didn’t move, nor did he move. He just stood there quietly, staring at Xiao Ao Shuang.

The atmosphere was extremely stiff, and only the sound of the wind could be heard.

Jonathan’s palms were moist with sweat. They couldn’t fight like this. Although Xiao Ao Shuang had improved a lot during this period of time, the other party was still a Dentain. He did not want anything to happen to Xiao AoShuang, not even a little bit of damage.

“Qi Ao Shuang, get stronger.” The wind suddenly stopped after Dittens said those words in a low voice. The surroundings quieted down, and Dittas did not say anything else. He turned around and left alone.

Qi Ao Shuang stood still, but her eyes became colder and colder.

She understood that the battle with this man wouldn’t be too far off.

“Qi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang, are you alright?” Jonathan asked nervously.

“What can I do!” Xiao Ao Shuang replied snappily, then walked away with a sullen face.

Jonathan shivered and hurried after him.

After some discussion with Brill, Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan came out of the tower again. However, the mysterious man in white clothes did not appear again, causing Qi Ao Shuang to be bewildered. What was that man doing? Why did it never appear again?

A month flew by.

Qi Ao Shuang sat on the bed with her eyes closed, feeling the strange feeling that had just disappeared. It seemed that the breakthrough wasn’t too far off. Tomorrow, he would go to the Sky Tower and the ninth floor.

At that moment, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Qi Ao Shuang slowly opened her eyes, filled with doubt. Who could it be?

Opening the door, he saw Parina’s extremely haggard appearance. Her eyes were bloodshot and dark circles covered them. Her face was pale and a little green. However, her eyes were extremely firm.

“Parina?” What’s wrong? “If you want to ask about your brother, then don’t worry. Your brother is fine right now.” Qi Ao Shuang did not move aside, but stood in front of the door and said.

“Is that so?” Thank you. “I came here today because I have something that I want to talk to you about.” Parina pursed her lips, seemingly trying to cheer herself up.

“What is it?” Qi Ao Shuang asked indifferently. She knew that she could not give the person in front of her a shred of hope, or else, in the end, she would be filled with endless despair.

"Tonight, you must come to the grove by the lake, the place where we first met. “Please, I have something important to tell you.” Parina looked up and said seriously while biting her somewhat pale lips.

“What can’t I say here?” Xiao Ao Shuang turned her head slightly, not looking at Parina, and said these words in a low voice.

“Not here.” “It’s a very important matter!” She turned around and quickly ran away. After running a few steps, she turned around and added, “I’ll be waiting for you there tonight. It’s really important. You have to come!”

Without waiting for any reaction from Qi Ao Shuang, Parina quickly ran away.

Looking at Parina’s back, Xiao Ao Shuang thought about what happened that made Parina react in such a way. Was it really important? Could this be related to the conspiracy behind the Star Academy? Thinking of this, Xiao Ao Shuang’s face turned solemn. If that was the case, then he really needed to see Parina and ask her what was going on. After pondering for a moment, Xiao Ao Shuang went back and closed the door.

Of course, what Xiao Ao Shuang didn’t see was that within Dittas’ dorm, Dittas, who was sitting on his bed with his eyes closed and resting, suddenly opened his eyes, a faint sullen look in his eyes.

That night, Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan left the cafeteria after dinner. Qi Ao Shuang turned to Jonathan and said, “Go back first, I still have some matters to attend to.”

“What is it?” “Where are you going?” Jonathan asked hastily.

“It’s just a small matter, you can go back first.” Xiao Ao Shuang did not say anything more. She left Jonathan and turned around to leave.

“Sigh, Ao Shuang, Ao Shuang …” Jonathan called out to Qi Ao Shuang, but Qi Ao Shuang ignored him and continued to walk forward. Jonathan stood there for a long time, thinking, and then left.

Qi Ao Shuang slowly walked forward and arrived at the quiet little forest. Under the night sky, the forest seemed even quieter, with only the occasional sound of insects. At night, this place was deserted. It was a good place for peace and quiet.

After sitting down, Qi Ao Shuang waited for Parina to arrive. Pieces of leaves fluttered in the air. Qi Ao Shuang extended her hand and grabbed a leaf, gently stroking it.

Suddenly, light footsteps came from the forest. Qi Ao Shuang did not move. She could tell that the footsteps belonged to Parina. Sure enough, after a while, Parina appeared in front of Qi Ao Shuang.

“Qi Ao Shuang, you’re here …” I beg of you, you will still come, won’t you? " Parina slowly approached Qi Ao Shuang, a strange light flickering in her eyes.

“What do you want, tell me.” “Is this something related to the Star Academy’s conspiracy?” Xiao Ao Shuang frowned slightly, but didn’t reply to Parina. Instead, she coldly asked this question.

“You think this is the reason?” A look of disappointment appeared on Parina’s face.

“What else do you think it is?” “I think I made it clear that it’s absolutely impossible between you and me.” Qi Ao Shuang’s expression turned colder and colder. If the reason Parina called him here was just to say these things, then he had really come at the wrong time! Qi Ao Shuang said in a cold voice and was about to leave.

“Wait!” Xiao Aushuang, I called you here because I really have something to do. “There really is a secret behind the Star Academy.” Seeing that Qi Ao Shuang was about to leave, she hurriedly opened her mouth and said those words.

Sure enough, there was some astonishment on Qi Ao Shuang’s face. She turned to Parina, who had an anxious look on her face, and asked, “What is it?”

"I have a companion beast who heard the argument between the principal and the elder. “They, they don’t seem to belong to this world. They came to this world to work for a certain person or force.” Parina stared fixedly at Xiao Aushuang and quickly told her what she found out.

Qi Ao Shuang’s eyebrows furrowed together as her face grew serious. She slowly walked back to her seat and sat down. Patting the seat beside her, she said to Parina, “Sit down and let’s talk.”

“Alright.” A smile appeared on Parina’s face. She hurriedly went over and sat down, then began to explain the dispute between the headmaster and the elders in the headmaster’s office.

After Xiao Ao Shuang heard this, her expression became more and more serious. Parina’s news was startling, but when she thought about it carefully, she wasn’t surprised. And the person that the dean spoke of, the person that the elder had released, could it be that mysterious white-clothed man? The white-clothed man was originally their prey, but he was still let go by that elder. At that time, it was likely a world-shaking fight that shook the entire Stellar Tower. Did that man in white know the Dean’s true purpose?

They did not belong in this world, but in order to return to their original hometown, did they hold a position in the Star Academy? Where was their home? Could it be in another plane? Thinking of this, Qi Ao Shuang’s heart sank. The people or powers behind them probably wouldn’t be so simple. The entire chaosworld was being toyed with by that person or force. One could imagine how terrifying that person’s strength was!

“Qi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang?” Parina carefully called out to the absent-minded Qi Ao Shuang.

“Huh?” “Oh.” Xiang Ao Shuang came back to his senses, looking at the hopeful look on Parina’s face, he smiled and said, “Parina, thank you for this news. It’s very important, and very useful to me.”

“As long as it’s useful to you.” A smile appeared on Parina’s face. Only now did her haggard face brighten a little. One could imagine how miserable her life had been after being completely rejected by Qi Ao Shuang.

“Well, thank you.” I will uncover the truth of this as soon as possible. Not to mention your brother. “I’ll go back first.” Xiao Aushuang stood up and was about to leave. She needed some time to properly digest the information that Parina had given her today.

“Wait!” “Qi Ao Shuang!” Just as Qi Ao Shuang stood up to leave, Parina stood up abruptly and threw herself into his arms.

“Parina!” Qi Ao Shuang’s expression changed immediately. She reached out her hand, trying to pull Parina out of her embrace. However, Parina used all the strength in her body to tightly hug Qi Ao Shuang’s waist, unwilling to let go no matter what.

“Qi Ao Shuang, I like you. I’ve never liked anyone before, and I’ve never been so worried about anyone. I really like you …” Parina’s subsequent desperate confession made Qi Ao Shuang even more upset.
